##Descriptions des fonctionnalités

###Rôle admin :

-  Gérer les inscriptions des membres aux tournois: 
    + We have two buttons for inscriptions of members to the tournament :
        * Save => save the list of assigned members but keep the tournament open
        * Close inscriptions => close the inscriptions in the tournament and displays the results for each game.
            The admin and the member cannot manage inscriptions/subscribe to a Tournament when it is closed.

-   Visualiser le résultat des tournois:
    + When a game is created, the scores are set by default at "-1" to indicate that the player hasn't updated 
        his score yet.
    + If both players have updated their scores, the match is closed
